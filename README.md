# Embedded-Cybernetics
A re-iteration on some of the complex safety-critical systems that have failed a long time ago; as a result of the aligment of latent system failures with the active failures triggering catastrophic events. The iteration will uncover the essential scientific factors that have led to these major catastrophic events in addition to providing maneuvers that could be introduced to make the industry much safer.

**Essentially, 4 major catastrophic are covered in this re-treat:**

**1) [Therac-25](https://github.com/Electrostat-Lab/Embedded-Cybernetics/tree/master/therac-25)**: a discontinued catastrophic radiation therapy produced by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), that has led to many casualties as a result of concurrent programming issues (aka. Race Conditions of Malfunction-54) in addition to arithmetics overflow overwrite operations in commands.

**2) Air France Flight 447, aka. the Titanic of the Skies**: a tragic aircraft Atlantic crash in the aviation industry attributed primarily to failure of the hardware interface of pitot tubes (altimeter pressurized sensors), failure of FMCs (Flight Management Computers), and eventually loss of the situational awareness.

**3) Deepwater Horizon**: a catastrophic failure of an oil rig platform as result of the alignment of latent failures (failure of the blowout preventers BOP hardware due to inappropriate wiring) with the subsequent active failures (failure of the blind shear ram valves) leading to the catastrophic failures (i.e., the gush of the highly pressurized ignitable oil and gas from mud onto the rig catching fires).

**4) Skylab Attitude Control Issues**: a detailed analysis of the catastrophic failure of the embedded software involved in the Skylab Space Station Orbit decay and disintegration of the platform from its orbit.

The type of analysis will use a couple of **abstract mathematical models** namely **the Tricotyledon System Design Theory (T3SD)**, which combines both the automata theory together with the set theory, the Swiss Cheese Model and cybernetics (recursive feedback models), and eventually some continuous mathematical models that will lay down the behavior of the malfunctionality.
